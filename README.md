## Dependencies

* `python3`
* `gsettings` or `feh`  To set the generated wordcloud as the wallpaper
* `xvfb`  To simulate a display and run everything in memory
* `firefox` web browser

### Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* `selenium`  To scrape the data from [Google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/daily?geo=IN)
* `pyvirtualdisplay` Python wrapper for `xvfb`
* `wordcloud` To generate the wordcloud
* `PIL`  Python imaging library

**NOTE** You will need to download the webdriver for `selenium`. [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/) (webdriver for firefox) can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). 

## Setup

* Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shardul08/Google-Trend-Wallpaper.git
```

* Change directory to the repo

```bash
cd Google-Trend-Wallpaper
```

* Run `setup.sh` with

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will install all the required dependencies and set the wallpaper.

## Usage

Run `./updateWallpaper.sh` to update the wallpaper to the wordcloud of the latest trends.

You can set your region/country to get the trending searches in `line #30` of [`generateWallpaper.py`](https://github.com/shardul08/Google-Trend-Wallpaper/blob/master/generateWallpaper.py)

You can set the number of days for which you want the trending searches in `line #31` of [`generateWallpaper.py`](https://github.com/shardul08/Google-Trend-Wallpaper/blob/master/generateWallpaper.py)

**NOTE** If the wallpaper is not set automatically, you can set `wallpaper.png` as the wallpaper manually.

If you want the wallpaper to refresh/update every hour, you can add a cron job to run the script every hour.

To add a cron job, run

```bash
crontab -e
```

append the following

```
0 * * * * cd path/to/script/directory && ./updateWallpaper.sh > /tmp/wallpaper.log > 2>&1
```

This will refresh the wallpaper every hour. You can customize this command to refresh the wallpaper as often you want.

If you want adjust the brightness of the wallpaper you can use the dim or brighten commands:

```bash
./setBrightness.sh dim|brighten XX
```

Where XX is the percentage you would like to dim or brighten the image. For example `./setBrightness.sh dim 20` would dim the current wallpaper by 20% and then set the new image as your background. Again you can set wallpaper.png manually if it fails to do it automatically.
